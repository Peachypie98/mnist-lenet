# MNIST & LeNet-5
## What Is MNIST and Goal For This Project
* The MNIST dataset is a large database of handwritten digits that is commonly used for training various image processing systems. It contains 60,000 images of training set and 10,000 images of test set. The handwritten digit images have been size-normalized and centered in a fixed size of 28Ã—28 pixels. 
* I will use slightly modified LeNet-5 Model to train these images and resized the images to 32x32 pixels.

## LeNet-5 Architecture

LeNet-5 is a very efficient convolutional neural netwrok for handwritten character recognition. It is a small network that contains basic modules of deep learning: convolutional layer, pooling layer and fully connected layer. Moreover, LeNet uses average pooling and tanh activation function. However, in this project I will use max pooling with ReLU activation function. The rest of the configurations are the similar to base architecture.
